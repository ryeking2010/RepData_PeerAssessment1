## Loading and preprocessing the data
```{r file_import}
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(data.table)
library(stringr)
file_path <- "C:/Users/I0485672/Downloads/activity.csv"
data <- read.csv(file_path)
```

## Analyzing the data

There are some NA's in here. They will be removed until imputed step.
Why? They don't have the device on or working.
We cannot say that means zero steps.

## Let's look at the total number of steps taken each day
```{r daily_sum_of_steps}
data_summary <- data[complete.cases(data), ] %>% group_by(date) %>% summarize(mean=sum(steps, na.rm = TRUE))
data_summary

data_summary %>% ggplot(aes(x = mean)) + geom_histogram(bins = 20) +
  theme_bw() + labs(x='Mean steps per day', y='Number of occurances', 
                    title = 'Frequency of mean steps per day')
```


## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?
```{r mean_and_median}
data_summary <-  data[complete.cases(data), ] %>% group_by(date) %>% summarize(StepsSum=sum(steps, na.rm = TRUE))
mean(data_summary$StepsSum)
median(data_summary$StepsSum)
```

What's the max steps in a given interval?
```{r findMax}
data_summary.max <-  data[complete.cases(data), ] %>% group_by(interval) %>% summarize(StepsMax=max(steps, na.rm = TRUE))
tophit <- data_summary.max %>% arrange(desc(StepsMax)) %>% head(n=1)
tophit
```
The largest interval is, 835 with 206.169811320755 max steps on average


## What is the average daily activity pattern?
```{r timeseries_mean}
data_summary <-  data[complete.cases(data), ] %>% group_by(interval) %>% summarize(mean=mean(steps, na.rm = TRUE))

ggplot(data_summary, aes(x = interval, y = mean)) + 
  geom_point() + geom_line() + theme_bw() + 
  labs(y="Mean steps", x = "Minutes from start of day", 
       title = "Average number of steps during the day")
```

## Imputing missing values

How to impute data? There's many many theories out there
1. mean - on each interval
2. nearest neighbor - for example, steps on a Saturday vs. Monday and take mean
3. So much more, but #2 is really good.

Let's do the mean of the days of the week for the given interval
If you really wanted a nice imputation, perhaps a lagging average?

```{r impute}
data.avg.per.weekday <- data
data.avg.per.weekday$date <- as.Date(data$date) %>% weekdays()
data.avg.per.weekday <-  data.avg.per.weekday[complete.cases(data.avg.per.weekday), ] %>% group_by(date, interval) %>% summarize(mean=mean(steps, na.rm = TRUE))


data.meanImpute <- data
for (i in 1:nrow(data.meanImpute)){
  if(is.na(data.meanImpute[i, 1])){
    data.meanImpute[i, 1] <- data.avg.per.weekday %>% 
      filter(date == weekdays(as.Date(data[i, 2])) & interval == data[i, 3]) %>%
      .[[3]]
  }
}
```

### Visualizing imputed data
Let's make a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day after missing values are imputed

```{r imputeHistogram}

data.check <- data.meanImpute %>% group_by(date) %>% summarize(DailySteps = sum(steps))

data.check %>% ggplot(aes(x = DailySteps)) +
geom_histogram() + theme_bw() + 
  labs(y="Days with number of steps", x = "Daily steps", 
       title = "Average number of steps during the day")
```

## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
Let's use this for a days of the week plot
```{r daysofweek}
# let's get the days of the week reordered properly for the graph
data.meanImpute$date <- weekdays(as.Date(data.meanImpute$date))
data.meanImpute$date <- factor(data.meanImpute$date, levels = 
                                    c("Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", 
                                      "Thursday", "Friday", "Saturday", 
                                      "Sunday"))

data.meanImpute.eachday <- data.meanImpute %>% group_by(date, interval) %>% summarise(meanSteps = mean(steps))
data.meanImpute.eachday %>% ggplot(aes(x = interval, y = meanSteps, color = date)) +
  geom_line() + theme_bw() + facet_wrap(~date) + 
  labs(title = "Average steps across days of the week\nwith imputed data",
       x = "Time in minutes", y = "Average mean steps")
```

Looks like people are more active saturday night and weekday mornings

They may want weekdays VS weekends, not all days.
```{r weekDAYSvsENDS}
data.meanImpute$date <- str_replace(data.meanImpute$date, "Saturday", "Weekend")
data.meanImpute$date <- str_replace(data.meanImpute$date, "Sunday", "Weekend")
data.meanImpute$date <- if_else(data.meanImpute$date == 'Weekend', 'Weekend', 'Weekday')
data.meanImpute.final <- data.meanImpute %>% group_by(date, interval) %>% summarise(meanSteps = mean(steps))

data.meanImpute.final %>% ggplot(aes(x = interval, y = meanSteps, color = date)) +
  geom_line() + theme_bw() + facet_wrap(~date) + 
  labs(title = "Average steps across days of the week\nwith imputed data",
       x = "Time in minutes", y = "Average mean steps")
```
